I am currently a postdoctoral research associate and galaxy evolution and cosmology (GECO) fellow in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Virginia. 
My interests include Local Group dwarf galaxies, star clusters, stellar streams, galaxy kinematics, and dark matter (and the intersection of these topics).
I am involved in several Milky Way and near-field cosmology projects including the <span style="color:blue"> [DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey (DELVE)](https://delve-survey.github.io/) </span>, the <span style="color:blue"> [Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5)](https://s5collab.github.io/) </span>, the <span style="color:blue"> [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) </span> (Milky Way working group), and The Magellanic Satellites Survey (MagLiteS). 
These projects are searching for new dwarf galaxies and stellar streams or characterizing them with spectroscopy.  
I was a postdoctoral research associate and Mitchell Astronomy Fellow in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Texas A&M University from 2016-2019 and a postdoctoral research associate at Carnegie Mellon University in the department of Physics from 2019-2024.  
I completed my graduate work at the University of California-Irvine, working on dynamical models of galaxies under the supervision Manoj Kaplinghat.
